# Coding Interview Tips

## General Tips

The book [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is the standard recommended text. If you're not able to purchase it, I would take a look at the [contents](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/contents.html) and try to read up about the list of topics online. These include: Big O, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees and Graphs, Recursion and Dynamic Programming, Sorting and Searching, and Threads and Locks.

I would recommend using C++, Java, or Python as a coding language. I was once told by a company that they preferred I use a statically typed language like C++ or Java, but most places will gladly accept Python. Python's terse syntax can also help you arrive at a solution with less writing. Ultimately, you should choose one of the three (probably the one you have the most experience with) and stick with it.

In 2019, I worked with Matt (not real name), a college junior, to prepare for software engineering interviews. In addition to some coaching on topics like the above, I helped source problems for Matt to work through at his own pace. I decided on the online platform LeetCode, which supports a variety of languages and shows how your runtime and memory compares against those of other participants. 

The rest of this README contains a list of problems we selected, from the online platform LeetCode. These are all from the free section of LeetCode; you can also pay for access to other problems. LeetCode has forums that you can look through if you get stuck, which contain many complete solutions.
